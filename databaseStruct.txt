coinjumper db structure
=======================

each key prefix used for subgroups should have an [attribs] list which includes all (or most) subkeys.
The existance of %s:attribs will be tested for to see if %s is the last subkey (ie carries a value) 

subkeys forming a <subkeyDescription> or the like have an associated indexSubkeyDescription key (eg <name> and indexName or <id> and indexId)
They should not have plurals
for any <somethingHere> there should be an associated indexSomethingHere - capitalisation matters

<class> is arbitrary and used for categorization
<group> is the 'presets' one has for item customization for *one type of item only* (like sandwich, coffee, burger, etc)
